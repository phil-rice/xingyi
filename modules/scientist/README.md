The idea is to prove replacement systems in production.

We do this by serving the customer from the old code, and then evaluate the new code. 
We then compare the two and see if they are giving 'the same' result. Because of the 
existance of dates and IDs 'the same' needs to be defined

This can also be used as a champion/challenger. Perhaps it should be 
expanded to allow multiple systems instead of just two
